# dvlopt.mbus

Thin clojure wrapper around [JMbus](https://www.openmuc.org/m-bus/) for
communicating with [Meter-Bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter-Bus) slave
devices.

Supports a (very) wide variety of platforms.

## Installation

This library needs [jRxTx](https://github.com/openmuc/jrxtx) for using serial
ports. For instructions, refer to [Clotty](https://github.com/dvlopt/clotty), our
own clojure wrapper.

Then, simply add the following dependency to your project :

## Usage

Read the full [API](https://dvlopt.github.io/doc/dvlopt/mbus/).

In short :

```clj
(require '[dvlopt.mbus       :as mbus]
         '[dvlopt.mbus.wired :as mbus.wired])


;; Open a connection on the serial port.

(def connection
     (::mbus.wired/connection (mbus.wired/open-serial "/dev/ttyUSB0"
                                                      {::mbus/timeout   1000
                                                       ::mbus/baud-rate 2400})))


;; Request user data from slave 0

(mbus.wired/req-ud2 connection
                    0)
```

## Status

If you need wireless M-Bus, you need to interop with
[JMbus](https://www.openmuc.org/m-bus/). We will write a wrapper as soon as we
have the relevant hardware to test it.
